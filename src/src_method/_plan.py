"""Memory planning for the SRC sweep: budgets, batch sizes and environment tiers.

`make_plan` is a pure function of the core shapes, the sketch size, the dtype, the
number of devices and the budgets, so the plan of a run can be inspected, and
tested, without loading any data or touching a GPU.

With several devices, every device runs the same plan on its block of the sketch
columns and of the rows of the projected environment; the plan is that of the
largest block, and of rank 0, which also gathers the sketch and runs the QR.
